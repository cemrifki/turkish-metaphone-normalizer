# 🇹🇷 Turkish Metaphone Text Normalization

This repository provides an **original Metaphone implementation for Turkish**, developed to normalize words phonetically and reduce variations in spelling caused by pronunciation differences.

Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm for indexing words by their sound, primarily used in English.  
This project adapts the idea for **Turkish phonetics**, accounting for similar-sounding consonant and vowel groups.

---

## 🧠 Motivation

Turkish words may often differ in **spelling but not in pronunciation** — for instance:
- `meclis` and `mejlis` sound almost identical, though spelled differently.  
- `güzel` → `gsl`, simplifying pronunciation-based matching.
- `şeker`, `seker`, and `zheker` could all normalize to a similar phonetic root.

This algorithm aims to support **text normalization, fuzzy matching, and search applications** in Turkish Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🧩 Features

- Groups Turkish letters with **phonetically similar sounds**:
  - `c`, `ç`, `j` → same group
  - `s`, `ş`, `z` → same group
  - `k`, `ğ`, `g` → same group
  - `ı`, `i` → vowel group
- Converts words into **metaphone representations**
- Handles **case-insensitive** text
- Designed to integrate easily into other Turkish NLP pipelines

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Run example script

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2️⃣ Example output

```bash
Original: meclis
Metaphone: MJLS

Original: güzel
Metaphone: GSL

Original: şeker
Metaphone: SGR
```

### 🔧 Example Python usage

```python
from src.turkish_metaphone import TurkishMetaphone

tm = TurkishMetaphone()  # No arguments here

# Then call the normalization methods on each word:
words = ["meclis", "güzel", "şeker", "mejlis", "çağla", "sokak", "armut", "zeki", "çocuk"]

for w in words:
    print(f"{w:10s} → {tm.encode(w)}")
```

#### Output:

```bash
meclis     → MJLS
güzel      → GSL
şeker      → SGR
mejlis     → MJLS
çağla      → JGL
sokak      → SGG
armut      → ARMT
zeki       → SG
çocuk      → JJG
```
